-- Fix RLS policies for invites table to work with JWT-based authentication
-- Drop existing restrictive policies that use auth.uid() (which doesn't work with our JWT system)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins and Teachers can create invites" ON invites;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "View invites based on role" ON invites;

-- Temporarily disable RLS on invites table for our custom auth system
-- Since we're using JWT authentication instead of Supabase Auth
ALTER TABLE invites DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Alternative: Create permissive policies that work with our system
-- We can re-enable RLS later when we integrate with Supabase Auth properly

-- For now, we'll rely on application-level authorization in our routes
-- to ensure only admins and teachers can create invites

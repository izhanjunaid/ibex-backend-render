## üÜï Grade Section Homework System

### Overview
The Grade Section Homework System is an **additive feature** that allows teachers to create collective daily homework announcements for entire grade sections (e.g., Grade 6B). This system works alongside the existing class-based assignment system.

### How It Works
1. **Admin** creates grade sections and assigns teachers
2. **Teacher** creates daily homework PDFs containing all subjects' homework
3. **Students** see one consolidated homework announcement per day from their grade section teacher

### Key Features
- **Collective Homework**: One PDF per day with all subjects
- **Role-based Access**: Teachers manage their assigned grade sections
- **PDF Upload**: Support for PDF homework files
- **Student View**: Students see homework from their grade section teacher
- **Non-disruptive**: Works alongside existing class assignments

### Database Tables
- `grade_sections` - Grade section definitions
- `grade_section_enrollments` - Student enrollments
- `homework_announcements` - Daily homework announcements

### Example Usage
```javascript
// Create a grade section
POST /api/grade-sections
{
  "grade_level": 6,
  "section": "B",
  "name": "Grade 6B",
  "teacher_id": "uuid",
  "academic_year": "2024-2025"
}
